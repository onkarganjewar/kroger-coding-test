# Dataset Used:
For this project, I decided to include a dataset that will have all the attributes/values that are already present and used in the variety of existing e-commerce systems. Also, the products items are auto generated using a script rather than manually. Since the mock data contains meaningful values rather than a collection of randomly generated arbitrary strings, it is easier to debug and parse the input data set.
